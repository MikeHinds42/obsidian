In a GURPS Fantasy game, using skills like Naturalist (Herbs), First Aid, Pharmacy, and Physiology, you can create a simple system for brewing potions. Here’s a basic framework for how these skills could be used in potion-making, balancing game mechanics and fantasy flavor.

### Steps for Making Potions

#### Identify Ingredients (Naturalist)
- Skill Used: Naturalist (Herbs)
- Task: Finding the necessary herbs and ingredients in the wild. The GM sets the difficulty based on the rarity of the ingredients:
- common herbs: Easy (IQ+4)
- Uncommon herbs: Average (IQ)
- Rare or magical herbs: Hard (IQ-2)
- Success means the character finds enough ingredients for one potion, while failure means they come up empty (or find a wrong, potentially dangerous herb).
#### Prepare Ingredients (First Aid or Naturalist)
- Skill Used: First Aid (for common/simple potions) or Naturalist (for more complex herbal remedies)
- Task: Preparing and processing the ingredients (grinding, boiling, etc.). This usually takes about 1-3 hours depending on complexity.
- Common: Easy (IQ+2)
- Uncommon: Average (IQ)
- Complex/Magical: Hard (IQ-2)
- Success means the ingredients are properly prepared. On a critical failure, the ingredients are ruined or potentially hazardous.
#### Brew the Potion (Pharmacy or Alchemy)

- Skill Used: Pharmacy (Herbal) for mundane potions, Alchemy for magical or complex potions
- Task: Combining the ingredients in the right way to create the potion. This step usually takes several hours to days depending on the potion’s potency.
- Simple healing potion: Average (IQ)
- Uncommon effect: Hard (IQ-2)
- Rare or magical potion: Very Hard (IQ-4)
- A successful roll produces a functional potion. Failure might mean a weaker version or an unpredictable result.
#### Determine Effects (Physiology)
- Skill Used: Physiology (or Pharmacy for basic analysis)
- Task: Knowing how the potion affects different beings. This skill is useful for customizing or ensuring a potion will work for non-human races or to diagnose any issues.
- The GM may ask for rolls when trying to create potions for non-standard races, magical creatures, or when dealing with highly specific effects like mental enhancement.

### Example Potions

|   |   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Potion Type|Ingredients Found with Naturalist|Prepared with First Aid/Naturalist|Brewed with Pharmacy/Alchemy|Effects Known with Physiology|
|Healing Draught|Common (Easy)|Easy (IQ+2)|Average (IQ)|Restores 1d HP|
|Antidote for Poison|Uncommon (Average)|Average (IQ)|Hard (IQ-2)|Neutralizes poison effects|
|Sleep Draught|Common (Easy)|Easy (IQ+2)|Average (IQ)|Causes deep sleep for 1 hour|
|Magical Rejuvenation|Rare/Magical (Hard)|Hard (IQ-2)|Very Hard (IQ-4)|Restores 2d FP|
### Modifiers and Quirks
- Assistants: A helper can give a +1 bonus if they are skilled in any relevant skill (Pharmacy, Naturalist, etc.).
- Time Modifiers: Rushing the potion-making process may impose penalties to the roll (-1 to -5 depending on how much you shorten the time).
- Tool Modifiers: Poor quality tools or no proper lab space imposes a penalty (-2 to -4). Good quality tools or a dedicated lab gives a bonus (+1 to +3).
- Magical Ingredients: If magical herbs or rare components are used, they may add bonus effects (or penalties if misused).
### Special Rules for Magical Potions
- For magical potions, Alchemy is required rather than Pharmacy, and the GM can impose additional requirements, such as magical reagents or time spent in a specific location (e.g., brewing under moonlight).
- Potions created with Alchemy can have special effects, like enhancing spells or granting temporary magical abilities.
### Critical Success and Failure
- Critical Success: The potion is more potent than expected—effects doubled, longer-lasting, or grants a bonus (e.g., a healing potion restores 2d HP instead of 1d).
- Critical Failure: The potion has unintended side effects or is harmful—poisons the user, doesn’t work at all, or has a completely random effect (GM discretion).
