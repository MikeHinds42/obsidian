To cast a spell choose a spell and a target. {check you still meet the reqs, and range to target}

  

Roll 3d6 vs spell + MODs  [ range, Magic Resistance(MR) etc, “On” spells]

Critical Success Zero cost + GM option, Success it goes off,

Failure 1 energy point (EP) except Information spells, Crit Failure full cost + GM Option table page 7

  

The time to cast requires consecutive concentration actions. During which you can choose to abort for free.

Any damage or distraction requires a will power test to continue The spell roll is made in the last concentration action.

  

Cost defined in the spell is paid when the cast is completed. If skill is > 15 then -1 cost, 20 > -2 cost.

You can use HP to pay for spell cost but take -1 on spell roll for each point bought like this.

A spellstone can be used instead but only for the whole cost.

  

Some spells have a maintenance cost to extend the duration for some EP (no roll), this is spent before or during the last turn the spell is active. Note each spell with a maintenance cost is an “On” spell and counts against spell tests.

  

Some spells have a resistance, crit spell success bypasses this. A knowing target can choose not to resist.

Make the spell test compere you margin of success to the targets resistance roll (rule of 16 B349)

  

Regular Spells - generally touch , range penalties as per range table, -5 if you cant see the target

No physical barrier affects a regular spell. See page 11 for naming a location or a person.

  

Area Spells - Area size governs cost by radius but not the spell test (min cost 1). You may state holes in the area but the cost is the same. The range is taken to the edge of the area.

  

Melee Spells - (no target needed) charge up in your hand or staff, spell test to create (most often instant),  next turn you can hold or do a melee attack or DX  to deliver. Failure to hit does not discharge the spell, You cannot cast another spell while holding a melee spell.if you drop staff or go unconscious then the spell dissipates. If you are grabbed the spell goes off. Note Armour protects the target (armor locations can be used). Also some spells state a resistance.

  

Missile Spells - Cast the spell (no target needed) and invest EP. For the next 2 turns you can hold, invest more EP (no roll) or range attack. After that you can only hold or attack. Once you hold you cant add more EP. While holding you can full-move, wait, aim, attack with off hand or defend.

  

Blocking Spells - can be cast as a defense action at any point when the character could defend. Only once per turn.

You can not  use it against a crit. You automatically lose any concentration you have, but not a held spell. No cost reduction for skill.
