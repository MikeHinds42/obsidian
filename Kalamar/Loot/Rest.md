### Sylwen’s Rest Mundane Treasures

These are valuable due to their age, craftsmanship, or materials, but they lack magical properties.

1. Elven Silver Goblet Set:  
    A beautifully crafted set of silver goblets with delicate filigree patterns. Though non-magical, these are valuable due to their artistic beauty and elven heritage. They are adorned with tiny, colorful gems.
    
2. Ancient Elven Coin Pouch:  
    A small, decayed leather pouch containing a collection of ancient elven coins made from silver, gold, and electrum. While their currency value has diminished, collectors and scholars would pay well for them due to their historical significance.
    
3. Ornate Elven Bow:  
    An intricately carved longbow of fine wood, adorned with silver and gold filigree. Its craftsmanship is excellent, granting a +1 to standard bow attacks, though it is not magical. The bowstring, however, is fragile and would need replacing.
    
4. Faded Elven Robes:  
    Once worn by high-ranking elven healers or druids, these robes are made of fine, nature-themed fabrics. Though they offer no protection, their design and materials are rare, making them valuable to collectors of ancient clothing or history.
    
5. Carved Stone Prayer Beads:  
    A string of prayer beads made of jade and other semi-precious stones, carved with ancient elven symbols of healing and protection. Though they hold no magical properties, their craftsmanship and cultural value are significant.
    
6. Worn Healer’s Journal:  
    A journal written by one of the last healers to inhabit Sylwen’s Rest. While mundane, it could provide valuable information about herbal remedies, elven healing techniques, and perhaps hints about hidden areas or secrets within the sanctuary.

### Sylwen’s Rest Magical Treasures

Items that have retained or absorbed elven magic, offering unique abilities.

1. Verdant Cloak:  
    A cloak woven from enchanted leaves and fibers that never decay. Wearing the cloak allows the user to blend in with natural environments (+2 to Stealth in forests and wilderness). It also provides minor protection from natural elements, reducing the effects of cold or rain.
    
2. Elven Healing Band:  
    A silver circlet with a soft, green glow. Wearing this headband grants the wearer the ability to heal 1d HP per day by touch, as long as the user speaks an ancient elven incantation. It also gives a +1 bonus to all healing-related skills.
    
3. Sylwen's Staff of Growth:  
    A wooden staff covered in vines and small, constantly blooming flowers. The staff can cast Plant Growth (p. M208) once per day and gives the wielder a +2 bonus to Nature spells. It is also imbued with healing magic and can be used to stabilize dying allies once per day (as the First Aid skill at level 12).
    
4. Heartstone of Sylwen:  
    A small, heart-shaped gem that pulses with faint green energy. When held, it grants the user the ability to cast Lend Energy (p. M96) once per day, restoring 1d FP to an ally. It also enhances the effectiveness of healing potions when within 5 feet (+1 to healing rolls).
    
5. Elven Spellbook of Vitality:  
    A small, leather-bound book containing nature-based spells, with a focus on healing and vitality. The book teaches the spells Lend Vitality (p. M95), Minor Healing (p. M93), and Purify Water (p. M129). For a mage with healing-focused abilities, this book is a valuable tool for expanding their magical repertoire.
    
6. Warden’s Quiver:  
    A finely crafted quiver that holds up to 20 arrows. Once per day, it can produce a single enchanted arrow of nature magic, such as an arrow that casts Entangle on impact or an arrow that deals +1d poison damage over time. The quiver is made of supple green leather with elven runes etched into it.
