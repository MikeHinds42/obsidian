The Eldar Elven Councilor who took the key to The Verdant Codex was Opus, a figure of immense wisdom and deep mystery. Opusr, one of the oldest living elves of his time, was known for his steadfast guardianship of ancient knowledge and artifacts that held great power. Born in the age of the First Elven Kings, Opus was a master of ancient magics, especially those tied to the natural world. He had long been a protector of Sylwen’s Rest, a sacred elven sanctuary where knowledge was kept safe from misuse.

Though wise, Opus was also wary—some said paranoid—of the potential dangers that the Codex represented. The Verdant Codex held secrets to controlling the very forces of life and nature itself, something that Opus believed could plunge the world into chaos if it fell into the wrong hands. When threats from both mortal and fae forces loomed over Sylwen’s Rest, he made the grave decision to remove the key from its vault. In his mind, only by hiding it away could the Codex remain locked and safe for all time.

Opus journeyed far to the Frozen Peaks of Grathmar, a forbidding and desolate range deep in the cold north. It was a place where few dared venture—a land of endless snowstorms and towering mountains, where ancient magic still lingered in the ice itself. Opus chose this location because of its isolation and the natural wards that surrounded it, remnants of long-forgotten wars between the giants of the north and the first elven settlers. Deep within the peaks, he found an ancient temple, carved into the side of a mountain long ago by a race of frost giants. There, in the heart of the frozen temple, Opus hid the key, sealing it behind powerful wards that only those of elven blood might have a chance to break.

It is said that Opus never returned from the north. Some believe he remains there still, watching over the key as a self-imposed exile, his spirit bound to the ice. Others say he perished in the cold, his body lost to the frozen winds. But the truth remains hidden, as does the key, and without it, the Verdant Codex remains locked away in Sylwen’s Rest, a treasure untouchable and yet still dangerously close to those who might seek it.

Eldar Opus took two additional books from the vault of Sylwen's Rest along with the key to The Verdant Codex. Both of these books contain powerful and rare knowledge, making them highly coveted by the Drow Loremasters, who have been hiding in the sanctuary. These Loremasters, experts in arcane studies and forbidden knowledge, seek these tomes for their own survival and expansion across the planes. Here are the books:

### 1. "The Breathing Stone: A Treatise on Survival in the Elemental Planes"

- Description: This tome is bound in thick stone-like skin, with pages that feel unnaturally cool to the touch. Written by the elemental mage Torvus Arcanar, it details his lifetime of exploration across the Elemental Planes—Fire, Water, Earth, and Air. The book covers the perils of these realms, the creatures that dwell within them, and, most importantly, how to survive their extreme environments.
    
- Contents: The book outlines magical techniques and alchemical methods to adapt to each plane's unique hazards. For the Plane of Fire, it describes protective wards against searing heat and how to summon fire elementals as guides. In the Plane of Water, it teaches spells of water breathing and pressure resistance. It also offers insight into the slow, crushing magic of the Earth Plane and the swift, unpredictable currents of the Air Plane.
    
- Why the Drow Loremasters Want It: The Drow Loremasters are in hiding, and they have ambitions that extend beyond their earthly sanctuary. They wish to expand their influence into the Elemental Planes, seeking new territories and resources. To do so, they need this survival manual to prepare themselves and their followers to traverse and conquer these hostile realms. Without it, any expeditions into these planes would be suicidal, as they lack the expertise to endure the elemental dangers they would face.
    

### 2. "The Infinite Crossroads: The Theory and Practice of Interplanar Travel"

- Description: This dark, leather-bound book shimmers faintly with the colors of different planes and is adorned with silver inlays that shift in design depending on the plane it is closest to. Written by Zyrric Aetharon, a renowned wizard and planar traveler, The Infinite Crossroads is a rare and comprehensive guide to traveling between the planes of existence. The book contains both theoretical knowledge and practical spells that allow for the opening of portals, the manipulation of planar boundaries, and the creation of safe havens in unstable realms.
    
- Contents: The book not only explains the mechanics of planar travel—detailing the boundaries between realms and how they can be pierced—but also warns of the dangers of the interplanar void, where creatures of unspeakable power dwell. It provides detailed instructions on how to craft interplanar portals, navigate the shifting pathways between dimensions, and avoid falling into the chaotic rifts that lie between known realms.
    
- Why the Drow Loremasters Want It: The Drow Loremasters seek The Infinite Crossroads to regain power and mobility beyond the mortal plane. As they hide in Sylwen’s Rest, they know their presence is not safe forever. With this book, they could open portals to alternate dimensions and escape should they be discovered. Furthermore, the ability to master interplanar travel would give them the power to extend their reach, build alliances with otherworldly forces, or even find refuge in realms unknown to their enemies. In particular, they wish to use this knowledge to open new pathways to their hidden cities, allowing their kin to travel in secret and unhindered by the barriers of the mortal world.
    

### Motivation:

The Drow Loremasters are desperate for these books to secure their survival and advance their hidden agenda. The Breathing Stone would allow them to establish a foothold in the Elemental Planes, a power play for resources and territory beyond the reach of their surface enemies. Meanwhile, The Infinite Crossroads would grant them the power to traverse the multiverse, creating secret routes of escape, conquest, and even alliances with dark forces from other planes. These books are vital tools for their ambition and continued evasion of the enemies that hunt them.
