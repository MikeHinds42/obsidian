Description:  
Vashrin is a mysterious, diminutive creature with a humanoid form but clearly otherworldly features. Standing only four feet tall, Vashrin’s skin is pale, with a faint iridescent sheen that almost seems to blend with the stone and shadows of the retreat. His eyes are large and entirely black, capable of seeing in the darkness that often fills Grathmar’s deeper halls. Vashrin wears an assortment of layered, worn robes in dark colors that help him vanish easily into the retreat’s hidden corners and passageways. His hands are dexterous and tipped with elongated fingers, perfect for precise and meticulous tasks, allowing him to maintain the retreat without leaving a trace. Vashrin rarely speaks and avoids direct contact with others, observing from the shadows and only intervening when absolutely necessary.

Background & Motivation:  
Vashrin was bound by Eldar Opus through a long-forgotten pact to serve as the silent caretaker of Grathmar. Loyal to Opus's wishes and bound by ancient magic, Vashrin maintains the retreat, ensuring it remains untouched and protected in Opus's absence. Though Vashrin is secretive, his protective instincts compel him to keep intruders from triggering the dangerous enchantments and hidden traps throughout the retreat. He has little desire to engage with outsiders but will appear briefly to aid the party if they stray too close to dangerous items or mechanisms. Vashrin's ultimate goal is to ensure the retreat remains ready for Opus’s return, though after years of solitude, he may feel a faint kinship with those who respect the sanctity of Grathmar.
