During the Fae invasion of the elven lands, when Sylwen’s Rest was abandoned, Tinker Lumespark refused to flee. In his desperation and ingenuity, he created the Chrono-Stasis Sphere, a magical device designed to suspend time in a localized area. Combining intricate clockwork and arcane enchantments, Lumespark activated the sphere within his workshop, trapping himself in a bubble of slow time. While outside the world moved on, inside, only moments passed for Lumespark, effectively preserving him for centuries. The device's quirks, however, leave him isolated—aware of time's passage but unable to interact with the outside world without unraveling the stasis entirely. The sphere flickers faintly, a reminder of its instability, and Lumespark knows it may not hold forever.
