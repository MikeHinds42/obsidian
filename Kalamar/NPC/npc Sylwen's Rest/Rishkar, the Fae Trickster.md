One of the few remnants of the Fae invasion that drove the elves out, Rishkar is a mischievous fae who stayed behind after his kin departed. Though the Elven Arcane Sentinels cannot sense his presence, he slips between the cracks of their defenses, playing pranks on intruders and explorers. His motives are unpredictableâ€”he might lead a wanderer into danger for fun or guide them safely to an elven relic, depending on his whims.
