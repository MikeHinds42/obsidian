A gentle, ancient treant who once roamed the far reaches of the Elven forest, Brindlethorn retreated to Sylwen’s Rest after his forest was destroyed by invaders. He now serves as a protector of the land, silently watching over the remains of the sacred grove, but he is cautious, keeping his distance from any who enter. His once-vibrant leaves are now tinged with sadness and loss, but he remains connected to the land’s dormant magic.
