### RaKane (Ra meaning Loremaster)

- Description: RaKane, once a high-ranking Loremaster of the Drow city of Za'raeth, is known for his obsession with forbidden knowledge. Unlike many Drow, RaKane was not satisfied with traditional arcane mastery—he delved into interplanar magic and sought ways to manipulate planar boundaries. His experiments were considered sacrilegious by Drow leaders, and when he was caught attempting to summon beings from other realms, he was marked as a traitor. RaKane and his companion RaSar fled from the city before they could be executed. The two have remained hidden for years, using their arcane skills to evade the hunters sent after them.
    
- Why Hunted: RaKane’s pursuit of interplanar knowledge endangered the Drow city, as his experiments risked opening rifts that could have drawn catastrophic beings into their realm. The ruling council saw him as a threat to their stability and power and sent a team of elite assassins to eliminate him.
    
- How He Remains Hidden: RaKane’s knowledge of planar travel allows him to manipulate space in subtle ways, bending it just enough to stay hidden from those tracking him. His mastery of illusion spells also helps him create false trails and deceive his pursuers. Sylwen’s Rest, with its ancient wards and strong healing magics, provides a natural haven, as the magical wards make it difficult for intruders to sense the presence of anyone hiding within its boundaries.

RaKane RaSar

Background: The two Loremasters are wanted by their own people for the dangerous and forbidden knowledge they possess. RaKane seeks to understand the planes beyond, and his thirst for such knowledge endangered the stability of his people. RaSar, loyal to him, became a fugitive by association and now uses her combat magic to protect them both. Despite being hunted, they have remained hidden in Sylwen’s Rest, a place of healing where the sacred magic of the land subtly masks their presence. The natural wards of the sanctuary have kept their enemies at bay for now, but the hunters grow closer with each passing year.
