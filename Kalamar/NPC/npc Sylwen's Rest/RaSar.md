- Description: RaSar is RaKane’s closest confidant and protector, a powerful mage who once served as an enforcer in the Drow court. She is skilled in elemental and defensive magic, having trained as a combat mage for many years. When RaKane was accused of heresy, RaSar chose loyalty over obedience to the Drow hierarchy and fled with him. Together, they’ve evaded capture by blending her combat prowess with RaKane’s esoteric knowledge. Though she may seem ruthless, RaSar is fiercely devoted to RaKane, believing in his vision of greater understanding through forbidden magic.
    
- Why Hunted: RaSar was labeled a traitor for aiding RaKane’s escape, and her knowledge of powerful elemental magic made her a prime target. The Drow council fears her abilities could be used against them if she and RaKane gain more power.
    
- How She Remains Hidden: RaSar’s elemental magic has helped her ward off assassins and alter the environment around them, creating defensive barriers and elemental distractions to mislead their hunters. In Sylwen’s Rest, her healing abilities and her attunement to natural elements allow her to subtly blend with the land’s magical wards.
