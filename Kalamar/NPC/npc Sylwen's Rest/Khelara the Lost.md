Khelara has questions but few answers.

Her mind has been shattered, her powers stripped and is dying.

She was trying to heal herself and mind at Sylwens Rest.  but is doing little more than sustaining her life.

- she was a sorceress of power and a disciple of the True.
- her link to her God has been severed removing her powers and breaking her mind.
- She was seeking the reason why this world is attracting so many links to other planes.
- Why has this increased over the centuries. 
	- The Underdark
	- The Iron Council.
	- The druids in the new lands
	- The water Elementalist in the far west.
	- Opus creates a portal to go stop the council a feat far beyond his believed skills and power.
	- now a Valith arrives.

- Still driven to find answers but leaving the rest she will die.
