Loradin is an elderly but determined human healer in his late 80s, his once-strong frame now frail, though his eyes still gleam with a sharp intellect. His long white hair falls loosely around his shoulders, and he moves slowly, but with purpose. Despite his age, Loradin is driven by an unrelenting passion to complete one final mission: retrieving The Verdant Codex, the lost elven tome of healing.

Over the course of his long life, Loradin became renowned as one of the greatest healers in the realm, learning not only from human masters but also studying under elven healers. During his time with the elves, he became fascinated by The Verdant Codex, a legendary book said to contain forgotten healing rituals and remedies. After decades of treating countless patients and pushing the boundaries of healing magic, Loradin heard rumors that the Codex was hidden deep within the dangerous and long-abandoned Old Lands, where Sylwen’s Rest, an ancient elven hospital, lies in ruins.

Though most consider him too old for such an endeavor, Loradin refuses to retire. He believes that recovering the Codex could unlock new cures for diseases and plagues that have baffled healers for generations. Now, he seeks to gather a group of adventurers willing to brave the treacherous journey into the Old Lands to help him recover the fabled tome. Time is running out for Loradin, but his mind is as sharp as ever, and his passion for healing drives him onward. He promises great rewards and the chance to learn forgotten secrets of magic to those who will help him complete this final quest.

Though old, Loradin’s vast knowledge and experience make him a valuable ally, even if he can no longer swing a sword or cast powerful spells as swiftly as he once did.
