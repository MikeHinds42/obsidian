The Fae court that once dominated the land was called The Ironveil Court, a ruthless and expansionist faction of the Fae realms ruled by the fearsome Queen Lirael, the Shadow Tyrant. For centuries, the Ironveil Court sought to conquer the mortal world, driven by an insatiable lust for power. Unlike other Fae courts that indulged in whimsy or illusion, the Ironveil Court was a war machine—its warriors brutal and its hunters merciless. They crushed villages underfoot, enslaved populations, and bent both human and elven lands to their will.

For 800 years, the portals between the mortal realm and the Ironveil's twilight lands remained open, an ever-present threat known to all who lived in the devastated territories. The Court's invasions were regular, swift, and bloody, leaving the lands scorched and broken. The mages of the mortal realms, though powerful, were unable to seal these portals. Instead, they could only erect wards and protections around strongholds and cities, making these places bastions against the relentless Fae.

But then, ten years ago, something changed.

Without warning, the Ironveil Court vanished. Their raids ceased, their hunters disappeared, and the portals—once gateways for their terrifying armies—remained silent. Yet the portals themselves are still open, as ancient and ominous as ever, looming like gaping wounds in the fabric of the world. The mortal mages had tried for centuries to block them, but nothing worked. Now, something unknown prevents the Ironveil Fae from crossing into the realm, something no one can explain.

Scholars, mages, and seers speculate, but none truly know why the Court has retreated or what is keeping them at bay. Some believe that a greater power has intervened, binding the Ironveil in their own realm, while others whisper of internal strife within the Court itself. What is clear is that the absence of the Fae has not gone unnoticed. Cautious explorers—human and elven alike—have begun venturing into the devastated territories, long abandoned and scorched by centuries of war. Yet even in the quiet, there is unease.

The lands are empty, but the portals remain. There are no signs of the Court’s hunters, yet it feels as though unseen eyes still watch from the shadows. Some fear that the Ironveil's disappearance is only temporary, that the silence is merely the calm before a storm far worse than any before. And the adventurers, unaware of the true nature of what holds the Ironveil back, can only guess at the forces at play as they cautiously step into the Fae’s abandoned strongholds, wondering if their return is imminent.
