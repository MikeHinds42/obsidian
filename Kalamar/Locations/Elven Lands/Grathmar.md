The journey to Grathmar, Elder Opus’s hidden retreat, winds high into the Frozen Peaks. Mist curls through the narrow mountain passes, thickening in a final, narrow valley that leads to the stronghold’s towering gate and stark stone wall. Sheltered by the mountain’s towering cliffs, the fortress is nearly invisible until one is almost upon it. The air is sharp and biting here, swirling with the thin veil of mountain fog, as if even the mists conspire to hide Grathmar’s secrets.

The sturdy gates creak open onto a functional courtyard, its cobbled ground lined with old but well-maintained stores and stable buildings. From here, the only visible entrance into the mountain looms, an unadorned but heavy door set directly into the rock. Once inside, the scale of the stronghold becomes clear. High above, a vast set of windows stretches across the cavern wall, though no light penetrates them now, as sturdy wooden beams have been drawn across them like shutters, concealing them from view outside. In clear weather, sunlight must pour through these hidden windows, filling the hall with an unexpected warmth and brilliance.

Within, the chill of the mountain air subsides. The stone corridors carry an ambient warmth, perhaps from the depth of the caves themselves. To the left lies a barracks and a common room, the long, empty rows of beds and tables suggesting it once housed twelve to twenty soldiers. On the right, a sturdy kitchen and a grand dining hall reveal craftsmanship that hints at Dwarven hands. The walls here are solid, built to withstand time and weather, though the tools and hearths within have long gone unused.

Straight ahead stands a large, ornately carved wooden door, strange in its subtle warmth. It almost hums with energy, as though enchanted to guard the passages beyond. It is a silent sentinel, its carved wood inviting touch yet guarded in its purpose, leaving any visitor to wonder what secrets lie behind it in the depths of the mountain retreat.

  

As the ornately carved door swings open, a gentle warmth spills from within, accompanied by a light as golden and clear as midsummer sunbeams. The stone walls of the complex are embedded with large, enchanted stones that radiate a soft, perpetual glow, casting each room in a light that feels both natural and comforting. Though the space is empty of people, every corner and surface is immaculately kept, as if an unseen caretaker has maintained the area in readiness for its master’s return.

  

The complex opens into a spacious common room, with sturdy chairs arranged around a low, polished table, its surface lined with carefully crafted maps and sketches of the surrounding lands and beyond. Shelves line the walls here, filled with books on ancient histories, magical lore, and philosophies of the arcane arts. A nearby study hosts a grand desk cluttered with ink bottles, quills, and a few worn journals, suggesting Opus’s presence still lingers in the well-used objects left behind.

  

Further in lies a chapel, surprisingly austere, where runes of protection are etched into the stone walls around an altar. It’s a space clearly intended for quiet reflection, with an air of deep serenity that seeps into the surrounding halls. Past this is the master residence itself—a grand yet modestly furnished suite, with an elegant four-poster bed, tapestries depicting scenes of distant, snow-covered landscapes, and a large wardrobe that hints at both practicality and the finest Elven craftsmanship.

  

At the far end of the residence, a large, heavily locked door marks the entrance to Elder Opus’s workshop. The door is crafted from a dark, ancient wood, polished to a near-reflective sheen, its surface inlaid with intricate, flowing Elven carvings that seem to pulse with latent magic. This door bears no handle, only three small holes arranged in a vertical row at its center: one circular, one square, and one triangular, each carved to a unique depth. The holes, faintly outlined by a silvery-blue glow, are keyways to a magical lock that requires specific items or shapes to unlock, an unmistakable ward against intruders.

  

The warm, magical light and immaculate state of Opus’s quarters give the distinct impression that he left with the intention to return, and the locked door to his workshop suggests that his greatest secrets still lie protected within.

  

Inside the workshop, the source of Grathmar's unnatural warmth is immediately apparent. At one end of the room stands a towering stone pillar, its surface cracked and glowing with veins of near-molten rock. The pillar radiates a powerful, ambient heat that seems to bleed into the walls, providing the retreat with a gentle, constant warmth even in the bitterest of winters.

  

The workshop itself is meticulously organized, with every tool, scroll, and vial in its place. The shelves are cleared of clutter, save for a few particularly important texts and crystal instruments, each aligned with precision. A faint hum of energy fills the air, almost palpable, as if the room itself were alive with a magic older than any mere enchantment.

  

Dominating the center of the workshop floor is a massive, twelve-foot diameter pentagram carved directly into the stone. Within it shimmers a portal, its edges wavering and almost organic in nature, as if it resists full containment by the Elven symbols etched around it. The portal pulses gently, exuding an eerie, silvery glow that seems to echo some unseen realm far beyond this one.

  

Opus’s nearby notes, spread across a stone worktable, offer fragments of insight. They detail his attempts to probe the source of the Fae's power, an effort driven by the hope of gaining a strategic advantage in the endless skirmishes with the otherworldly court. His notations reference strange encounters and landscapes observed through the portal, though his final entries are inconclusive. One line, heavily underlined, reads: “Barrier unyielding—Fae portal cannot be closed from this plane. Another method must be found.”

  

It seems that Opus left this space prepared yet incomplete, as if still hunting for the final piece of knowledge that might turn the tide of war. The portal glows, quietly active but restrained by his warding marks, an unresolved passage into the unknown that hints at the Elven Councillor’s unfinished battle against the Fae.
