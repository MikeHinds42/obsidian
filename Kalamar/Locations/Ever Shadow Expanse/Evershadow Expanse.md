The Evershadow Expanse is a plane of existence unlike any known to mortal realms. A realm of perpetual twilight, it is a world where darkness and light weave together seamlessly, creating an ever-changing tapestry of shifting shadows and silvery glows. The land itself is a mysterious expanse of obsidian forests, rivers of liquid shadow, and towering cliffs made of black crystal that reflect dim starlight. Time flows in a peculiar manner here, not in a linear fashion but in fragmented moments that ripple and overlap, lending the realm an otherworldly and almost dreamlike quality. It is said that to step into the Evershadow Expanse is to abandon the rigid laws of the mortal world and accept a dance of shadows and echoes.

The [[Valith.md]], native to this eerie realm, are beings of pure shadow and ephemeral essence, embodying the very nature of their plane. In the Evershadow Expanse, they drift like sentient wisps, existing without true physical form, feeding on the ambient energies of light and dark that fuel their strange existence. These beings are both feared and revered for their knowledge of the arcane and their mastery over shadow magic. However, their ethereal nature restricts them from fully experiencing the material sensations that exist in more corporeal planes. This drives their need to assume a tangible form when they venture beyond their native plane, using complex rituals to coalesce their essence into a temporary body forged from magic and shadow.

The motivations of the Valith for entering the material world vary greatly, as they are as individualistic as the shadows they embody. Some seek knowledge, driven by an insatiable curiosity about the rigid and time-bound realities of mortal existence. Others are drawn by whispers of power, seeking artifacts and mystical forces that would elevate their control over the boundaries between realms. A few even come with intentions to manipulate or conquer, hoping to extend the influence of the Evershadow Expanse into the mortal realm. However, the most profound motivation is often their desire to experience the sensations of corporeal life—touch, taste, pain, and joy—which their shadowy essence cannot fully comprehend in their native state. This yearning drives many Valith to take risks, forging alliances or engaging in conflicts that can entangle them deeply in the affairs of the material world.
