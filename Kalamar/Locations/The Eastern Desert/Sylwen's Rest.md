Description: Once a gleaming sanctuary of healing, Sylwen’s Rest now lies in eerie silence, an ancient elven hospital abandoned for centuries. Nestled deep within a mystical forest, its marble halls are overgrown with ivy and moss, the once-pristine fountains stagnant and dry. Tall, arched windows, cracked and broken, let in beams of sunlight that filter through the overgrown canopy, casting an ethereal glow over empty beds and crumbling herbal gardens. Faint whispers of lost healing magic linger in the air, and faded murals depicting ancient elven healers watch over the forgotten patients who once filled the ward.

History: Built during the height of elven civilization, Sylwen’s Rest was known for its advanced healing techniques, blending herbal remedies with powerful restorative magic. It was founded by Liriel Starbloom, whose Verdant Codex guided its practices. The hospital fell into ruin after a catastrophic magical plague swept through the region, decimating its population and leaving it abandoned in haste. Now, it is a place of legend, said to hold remnants of lost healing magic and secrets waiting to be rediscovered. Adventurers and scholars occasionally seek it out,
