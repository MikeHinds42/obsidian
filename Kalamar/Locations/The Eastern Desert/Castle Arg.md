### Castle Arg (Full Name: Gharak Thol)

Location: Situated on the critical trade route between the City of Dreams and the once-glorious Elven Lands, now cut off by a magical barrier, Castle Arg stands as a powerful fortress overlooking the rugged valley below.

Description:

Castle Arg, more accurately described as a fortress, is a massive structure hewn from black stone, resembling the deep fortresses of orcish warlords. Towering walls and battlements enclose a labyrinth of strongholds, courtyards, and tunnels. Its architecture is brutal and functional, built to withstand sieges for months. At its heart lies an imposing keep, reinforced by iron and adorned with orcish symbols, now weathered by time.

Originally known by the orcs as Gharak Thol (which roughly translates to "Fortress of Eternal Blood"), its name has been lost to the humans who now occupy it. Unable to pronounce the guttural orcish language, the humans simply refer to it as Castle Arg—a nickname that arose from the sound of the first part of the name, "Ghar."

History:

Gharak Thol was once a pivotal stronghold in the Orcish Warlord Bhaalgor's campaign against the elves. Built during the height of the orcish expansion, it was intended to serve as both a defensive bastion and a launch point for raids into the fertile Elven Lands. The orcs, famed for their endurance and brute force, kept the fortress near-impenetrable for centuries, withstanding multiple elven attempts to retake it.

When the Barrier was erected, severing the Elven Lands from the outside world, the orcs of Gharak Thol found themselves cut off from their primary purpose—conquering the elves. Over time, internal strife weakened the orcish hold on the region. Isolated, under-resourced, and without their main enemy to fight, Gharak Thol’s orcish garrison slowly dwindled.

The Fall to Humans: With the orcs reduced to infighting and raiding among themselves, a powerful human warlord, Lord Harven, saw an opportunity. Lord Harven, a shrewd tactician and leader of an alliance of human clans, had long desired control of the strategic fortress, both for its commanding position over the valley and for its military value.

Using diplomacy and deception, Harven struck deals with rival orc factions, promising them wealth and dominion if they helped weaken the garrison. Over several months, human scouts infiltrated Gharak Thol, sabotaging defenses and creating division among the orcs. When the time came, Lord Harven led a surprise assault during a night of orcish revelry, exploiting the weakened leadership.

The orcs fought ferociously, but Harven's forces, supported by mercenaries and local militia, overwhelmed the disorganized defenders. By dawn, the fortress had fallen to the humans. Lord Harven, impressed by the fortress’s endurance, decided to keep much of its orcish structure intact, establishing Castle Arg as a key military and trade stronghold along the road.

Present Day:

Now in human hands for several generations, Castle Arg has been repaired and fortified by its new rulers. It serves as a vital military bastion, guarding the road leading towards the ancient Elven Lands, now cut off by the Barrier. Though the humans have removed most visible signs of orcish rule, they have been unable to erase its grim history. Some say the spirits of fallen orcish warriors still linger in the halls, restless and vengeful.

Castle Arg stands as a symbol of human dominance over what was once an orcish empire, its walls now echoing with human voices, though the name Gharak Thol is still whispered in shadowed corners, reminding all of its brutal past.
